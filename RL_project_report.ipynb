        "Recent advancements in natural language processing and machine learning have led to the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) [1, 2, 3] capable of understanding and generating human-like text. Significant research has been devoted to aligning LLMs with specific tasks and domains to improve their performance. Alignment usually is perfomed as a last step after the supervised pre-training on a huge volume of data, usually followed by Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) [4, 5] allowing to rapidly and cost-effectively adopt LLM for a specific domain. Finally, comes the Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) [6, 7] stage, when we assume that the model has all the necessary knowledge for the valid generation, and we aim to correct the generation format. In this scenario LLM is considered as an agent, user prompt (previous text) is considered as an environment and an action is a generation of a specific token. Reward is usually a human feedback given in some form: it could be either grade of an answer, or simply \"like\" or \"dislike\". Sometimes more elegent options such as \"textual feedback\" are applied. Human feedback is given for the already generated answer (sequence of agent actions), therefore one of the complexities is how to distribute the reward among the sequence of actions.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Original RLHF methods [such as actor-critic-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)] [6] have trained a reward model based on the human feedback and then used this model as a critic, to train actor generating the most likeable answers. However, the problem of that approach is that we need to train an additional model, that leads to additional biases as the model is biased. Therefore, new family of reward-oriented RLHF methods was proposed, that is a Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) technique [7].\n",
        "\n",
        "For DPO-like methods, user should rate two answer (sequences of actions), inidicating which one is preffered. After that, DPO modifies LLM weights (policy) so that probability of preffered answer (sequence of actions) is increased simultaneously with descrease of  rejected answer (sequence of actions). For the DPO-like methods policy correction is evenly distributed among the actions. DPO does not require an additional critique model and focuses only on the actual human feedback, ensuring the alignment correctness.\n",
